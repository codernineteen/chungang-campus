# Browser based javascript multiplayer game boilerplate

This was a prototype to make a virtual classroom service of my university.
Because i will rewrite all codes into rust or other languages, I decided to reveal all codes for anyone who are interested in programming multiplayer game based on javascript.

Maybe the contents of branch is not stable because i was working on it, but you can still overview the architecture i used and the logic of implementations.

Client side implementation : Vanilla Typescript with OOP + three.js library
Server side implementation : socket.io version / geckos.io version / rust actix server version(this only supports socket connection, no synchronization)

Further details for each implementatin, check out branch and read source code!
