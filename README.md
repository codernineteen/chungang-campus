Virtual campus of my university

This is a prototype to make a virtual classroom service of my university.
Because i will rewrite all codes into rust, I decided to reveal all codes for anyone who are interested in programming multiplayer game based on javascript.

Maybe the contents of branch is not stable because i was working on it, but you can still overview the architecture i used and the logic of implementations.
